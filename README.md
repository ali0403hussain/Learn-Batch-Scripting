<br />Simple text files with lines of commands that are run one after the other are used to store batch scripts. These files are specifically named BAT or CMD. This kind of file is identified and operated via an interface (also known as a shell) supplied by a system file known as the command interpreter. This interpreter is called cmd.exe on Windows-based computers.<br />
All it takes to run a batch file is a single click. Additionally, batch files can be executed using the Start-Run line or a command prompt. Unless the file's path is in the path environment, the entire path name must be utilized in this situation.<br />

### Environment Variables
To execute batch files from the command prompt, you may either navigate to the location of the batch file or use the path environment variable to specify the file location. under the event that the batch file is kept under C:\Application\bin, you would have to include the PATH variable according to these instructions.<br />
Append the String; C:\Application\bin to the end of the system variable PATH in Windows.<br />
