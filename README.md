# Batch Script
Repetitive command sequences can be automated with the help of Batch Script. By automating these command sequences with scripting, one can reduce the need for this and increase productivity and ease of life at the shell. Most businesses use batch scripts in one form or another to automate processes.
## Features
* Has the ability to interpret user input so that it can be processed further. 
* Contains control structures for easier automation and scripting, such as for, if, while, and switch. 
* Supports sophisticated features like arrays and functions.
* Allows for regular expressions. includes more programming languages like Perl, Python, C, and so forth.
## Some Use Case
* Putting up servers for various uses.
* Automating tasks related to cleaning, such removing unnecessary files or logs.
* Automating the transfer of applications between environments.
* Installing software simultaneously on multiple computers.

<br />Simple text files with lines of commands that are run one after the other are used to store batch scripts. These files are specifically named BAT or CMD. This kind of file is identified and operated via an interface (also known as a shell) supplied by a system file known as the command interpreter. This interpreter is called cmd.exe on Windows-based computers.<br />
All it takes to run a batch file is a single click. Additionally, batch files can be executed using the Start-Run line or a command prompt. Unless the file's path is in the path environment, the entire path name must be utilized in this situation.<br />

## Batch Script Environment
Notepad is usually used to create batch files. The most basic tool for creating batch files is this one. The batch scripts' execution environment comes next. This is accomplished on Windows computers using cmd.exe, or the command prompt. Runs all batch files in this context.

### Environment Variables
To execute batch files from the command prompt, you may either navigate to the location of the batch file or use the path environment variable to specify the file location. under the event that the batch file is kept under C:\Application\bin, you would have to include the PATH variable according to these instructions.<br />
Append the String; C:\Application\bin to the end of the system variable PATH in Windows.<br />
